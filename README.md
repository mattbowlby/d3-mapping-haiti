# Introduction to D3 Web Mapping Through 4 Simple Maps of Haiti

This group of D3 maps of Haiti were inspired by a presentation by [@rgdonohue](https://twitter.com/rgdonohue) for [@maptimeLEX](https://twitter.com/maptimelex).  The complete set of maps used in the presentation can be found on their [GitHub page](http://maptimelex.github.io/d3-mapping/). The maptimeLEX maps draw upon Andy Woodruff's (@awoodruff) excellent [@maptimeBoston presentation](http://maptimeboston.github.io/d3-maptime/).

* All the files and data for the original maptimeLEX examples are hosted at: [maptimelex/d3-mapping](https://github.com/maptimelex/d3-mapping)
* Working examples of the maps have all been posted as Gists available here: [rgdonohue’s blocks](http://bl.ocks.org/rgdonohue), or you can see the [working examples](http://maptimelex.github.io/d3-mapping/) within @maptimeLex's GitHub repo.
